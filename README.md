# Iris Flower Classification

## Project Overview

The Iris Flower Classification project aims to classify iris flowers into three species: Setosa, Versicolour, and Virginica, based on the famous Iris dataset introduced by Ronald A. Fisher in 1936. This project leverages machine learning techniques to build a predictive model that accurately classifies the species of an iris flower given its sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width.

## Dataset

The Iris dataset contains 150 samples, each with four features: sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width. Each sample is labeled with one of the three species: Setosa, Versicolour, or Virginica. The dataset is available in the `data` directory as `iris.csv`.
